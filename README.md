## Game for small children,
### Made in UPBGE 0.2.8

Game in which small children learn how to recognize fruit and catch them in a small basket.
The fruit falls from the above and you can catch the fruit with a basket which is controlled
by the arrow keys. If you catch the wrong fruit you lose a life (out of 3 lives). You get a point
if you catch the right fruit.
At the beginning there is an option to choose a username and at the end of the game there is
a score board. Tutorial used for the high score: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auqWREjwO-w

UPBGE is an open-source 3D game engine forked from old Blender Game Engine, deployed with Blender itself.

The game is in Croatian language.
